## Testing RabbitMQ Connection

The files in this directory are a Kotlin test of the connection
to RabbitMQ using default localhost and port 5672 (default port).
Running these two applications will ensure libraries and RabbitMQ
configuration is working. Perform this test to ensure you are ready
to proceed to running your MicroServices.
